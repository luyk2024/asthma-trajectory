## Overview  
This project examines the association between early-life antibiotic exposure and childhood asthma development. Using data from the **Australian Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC)** and **Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme**, we investigate how antibiotic use in the first two years of life influences asthma trajectories from ages 6 to 15.

## Methods  
- **Dataset:** LSAC with linked Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data  
- **Participants:** 5,107 children, with 4,318 included in final analysis (84.6% retention)  
- **Exposure:** Antibiotic use from **0â€“24 months**  
- **Outcome:** Asthma phenotypes derived using **group-based trajectory modeling**  

## Key Findings  
We identified four asthma phenotypes:  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Always-low-risk (79.0%)**  
- ðŸ”µ **Early-resolving asthma (7.1%)**  
- ðŸ”´ **Early-persistent asthma (7.9%)**  
- ðŸŸ  **Late-onset asthma (6.0%)**  

### Association with Antibiotic Exposure  
- **Any early-life antibiotic exposure** â†’ **2.3Ã— increased risk** of early-persistent asthma (*95% CI: 1.47â€“3.67; p < 0.001*)  
- **Subgroup Analysis:**  
  - ðŸ“Œ **Second-generation cephalosporins** â†’ **2.7Ã— increased risk**  
  - ðŸ“Œ **Î²-lactam (excluding cephalosporins/macrolides)** â†’ **2Ã— increased risk**  

## Conclusion  
Early-life antibiotic exposure is linked to a higher risk of early-persistent childhood asthma. These findings emphasize the need for careful antibiotic use in infants, particularly for **viral infections where antibiotics are unnecessary**.
